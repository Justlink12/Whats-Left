This project was made for CofC CSCI 280. It was developed over the course of one month in a group of four. I worked mostly as the engine user and assembled the pieces and programmed the gameplay. The controls are: A and D for using the suit's battery supply.
Left and Right arrows use the astronauts energy. The goal is to make it as far as you can with the limited resources with several weather events that can either help or hinder you.
